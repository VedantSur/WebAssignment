    <p class="about">
        Hello everyone and welcome to my first ever attempt at creating a website using HTML and CSS.
        My name is Vedant and this website that you are browsing is part of an assignment for the subject Web Systems. 
        I am enrolled in University of Technology Sydney (UTS) as a first year student studying the Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence (AI) - Yes this is a course available in UTS.<br><br>
        Here are the list of subjects I am undertaking for the Autumn Semester:
        <ul id="units">
            <li>Communications for IT Professionals (CITP)</li>
            <li>Web Systems</li>
            <li>Programming 1</li>
            <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h3 class="headline">Below is image of the UTS Campus I took earlier this year</h3>
        <p class="about">This was taken from Building 10 facing the Library (Building 2).</p>
        <img src="UTS.jpg" alt="Campus" class="image2">

<h3 class="headline">Here a list of some of the hobbies I have:</h3>
<dl id="hobbies">
    <ul>
        <li>I like playing badminton</li>
        <dd>- I like to think I am a pretty decent player so I would be down if you would like to 1v1 me</dd><br>
        <li>I enjoy playing video games</li>
        <dd>- I primarily play mobile games (I know) but enjoy console games occasionally</dd><br>
        <li>I have recently started playing squash</li>
        <dd>- You would think that badminton and squash would be similar but it took me some time to adjust to the racquets</dd><br>
        <li>I like to go on long late-night drives while listening to music</li>
        <dd>- Admittedly I have had to stop doing this due to the insane fuel prices :(</dd>
    <ul>
