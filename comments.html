    <p class="about">This page of the website contains information regarding the technical, aesthetic, and accessibility 
        aspects of this website. These aspects are crucial to in order to design/create a functional and practicable website.
    </p>

    <h3 class="headline">Personal reflection of overall design</h3>

        <p class="about">I have ensured that the guidlines and specifications stated for the website are followed appropriately.
            I had numerous visions as to how I wanted my website to look however, I weighed out the pros and cons and eventually landed on 
            the design and format you are now seeing. I had a few different reasonings for this but the main two reasons are:</p>
            <ul class="reasons">
                <li>I wanted this website to be particularly simple to use and navigate through which is an important accessibility feature as this supports inclusion for those with disabilities, people from developing countries, the older generation and more. I have 
                    had to make certain design changes and decisions to make this website accessible.</li>
                <li>I wanted the website to have a modern, clean, simplistic, minimalistic and aesthetic design which would appeal the most if not all people</li>
                <li>Based on accessibility and aesthetic designs, I wanted a simple to follow website and content structure. This would also benefit my basic knowledge and experience with using HTML and CSS.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
            <h2 class="subhead">Technical Aspects</h3>

            <h3 class="headline">Structure of Website</h3>

            <p class="about">Adhering to the design specifications, this website has four webpages (HTML pages) and once cascading style sheet (CSS).
                See table below that gives a brief explanation of each type of file:
            </p>

            <table class="table3">
                <tr>
                    <th>Filename</th>
                    <th>File Type</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>index.html</td>
                    <td>HTML</td>
                    <td>This is the "home page" of the website which provides a short introduction of myself</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>past.html</td>
                    <td>HTML</td>
                    <td>This page describes my past experiences and achievements</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>future.html</td>
                    <td>HTML</td>

            </table>
            <br>
    
            <h3 class="headline">Webpage Structure</h3>
            <p class="about">Each page is similar in strucutre which has been done on purpose. The general structure of each webpage contains five major components with each containing distinct styling properties.</p>

            <ol class="structure">
  <li>
    <h4 class="subberhead">TOP CONTENT</h4>
    <p class="about">Located on the topmost portion of each page. There is not particularly useful information being displayed here. It only shows the subjest and the assignment name. Addind this ensures that the navigation panel
        is not located at the very top of the page which would give it an odd look especially with the styles used. This is also the only text in the entire website that has a different font.
    </p><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 class="subberhead">NAVIGATION PANEL</h4>
    <p class="about">Arguably the most important section of the webpages, the navigation panel allows users to navigate to
        different pages in the website. This navigation buttons use the '&lt;div&gt' element allowing to define a section in the page. The hyper links are created using the '&lt;a href&gt;' element.
        This is copied across <span class="hype">all</span> pages and the styling is controlled by CSS. The navigation panel is designed in such a way that it is in the same location and looks the 
        exact same on each webpage. By creating top and bottom borders for the navigation panel, it allows it to be distinctive from the rest of the page.<br> <br>A feature that I used in the navigation panel
        is the "hover" command. The viewer can 'hover' over the different pages which will bold and underline it. Although this may not seem to have major significance, it improves accessibility
        and aesthetic as the user can accurately determine which page they want to click. However, this is only available to devices with a cursor, this has been tested on a mobile device and the page is
        bolded and underlined when clicked. This feature can be improved for users with a mobile device and for improving accessibility. 
    </p><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 class="subberhead">HEADER</h4>
    <p class="about">The header uses the '&lt;h1&gt' tag indicating the user what page they are one. The '&lt;h1&gt' tag allows the content to be clearly seeing
        as it is located on the below the navigation panel. A bottom border is also included allowing to be more distinguishable for improved accessibility.</p><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 class="subberhead">CONTENT</h4>
    <p class="about">The content is below the Header and contains the main content of the page. The text used primarily used the '&lt;p&gt' tag for the majority of the 
        texts and paragraps (including this). Through CSS styling, I have ensured a specific font size and centering which appeals to accessibility and aesthetics. I have
        also used '&lt;h2&gt', '&lt;h3&gt' and '&lt;h4&gt' tags for smaller subheadings within the content. This helps highlight the content/information that is given in that section and provides
         structure and easiernavigation through the page. <br><br> The content section of the page also contains tables, lists and images which further add to the aesthetic and structure
         of the webpage. A limitation with images was that due to filesize constraints, high resolution images could not be used. This meant that any image that would be used would be lower
         resolution and its size in the webpage would be smaller. If scaled to a larger size, it would look odd and even irritating to the eyes. To overcome this, I used images that would still look
         fine from this resolution deficit and scaled it larger so it can be visibile and adds character to the page. I also used a border around the image to separate it from the background.
    </p><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 class="subberhead">FOOTER</h4>
    <p class="about">The footer is exactly the same as the header with the only difference being it is located at the bottom of the page instead of the top.
        Although this may seem like a lazy thing, this was done intentionally. Typically, users will read information from top to bottom and to click to a different
        page, they would have to scroll back to the top. By having a navigation panel at the bottom after the content, it allows users to switch to the different pages
        with ease. I have also kept the same design and layout for the navigation panel in the footer so it does not become confusing which further improves accessibility.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

    <h3 class="headline">See image below showing the general structure of a webpage</h3>
    <img src="webpage.jpg" alt="screenshare" class="image3">

    <p class="about">The image shows the general structure of the webpage and showcases some of the different tags, attributes and elements I have used.<br><br>
    Now that I have described the structure and given explanation behind each decision, we will look at aesthetics and accessibility features. I have mentioned these while 
    explaining the structure but here I will explain more in-depth.
    </p>

    <h2 class="subhead">Aesthetics and Accessbility</h2>

    <h3 class="headline">Colour Schematics</h3>

    <p class="about">Choosing a colour scheme for this website took much longer than anticipated requiring numerous trials with different colour schemes and asking others
         for opinions. Typically, I like to view content on "dark mode" which means that the content is on a dark background with the text being light coloured. Examples of this
         can be seen on many applications like Discord, Instagram, Snapchat, etc and websites like Google, Youtube, etc. This is also seen on Operating Systems
         like IOS, MacOS and Microsoft Windows. Taking inspiration from these and my own opinions, I originally set a dark gray solid background with a light beige colour for text. 
         This helped with a few things, it helped give the website a modern yet simple aesthetic and the contrast between the dark background and light text makes it easier to read and view content.
         This also helps with accessibility as it appeals to those with poor eyesight, older people and even colourblind people. To emphasise certain text, I used a vibrant orange (not exactly orange) that stands out from the rest of the text and the background.<br><br> Although this colour scheme was perceived well by many, the most common
         criticism was that it was a bit too simplistic. To counter this, many websites use animations with videos or an interactive slideshow which in which an image progresses as you scroll. There are many gimmicks I can use but keeping simplicity
         and accessibility in mind, I opted to have a design in the background which adds character and looks appealing. After trialing different patterns and designs, I landed on the one you can see currently.
         Here is the code I used in CSS to achieve this background <br> <br>

         body { <br>
  margin: 80px; <br>
  border: 1px solid gray; <br>
  background-color: #2C2C2C; <br>
  background-image: <br>
    linear-gradient(45deg, #1f1f1f 25%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 25%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 75%, #1f1f1f 75%, #1f1f1f),<br>
    linear-gradient(45deg, #1f1f1f 25%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 25%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 75%, #1f1f1f 75%, #1f1f1f);<br>
  background-size: 20px 20px;<br>
  background-position: 0 0, 10px 10px;<br>
  background-repeat: repeat;<br>
} <br><br>
The sections I trialed with were the angle, the colour and and transparency.
Another colour feature, that is a bit more subtle is in the table above. It can be seen that every second line has a darker background. Although this does not add much practicable meaning, it adds
more character and aesthetic instead of just a plain table. This is achieved using the followin codes in CSS<br><br>
.table3 tr:nth-child(even) {<br>
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);<br>
}
    </p>

    <h3 class="headline">Text Font & Size</h3>
    <p class="about">I have used the default font sizes from the '&lth&gt' tag including its bold properties. The only text-decoration I have changed is adding underline.
        Through trial and error, I figured out which heading tags I want to use and where I would use it. I did not change the font as the default font (Times New Roman) works well
        as words and letters are clearly readable and it is a familiar font. <br><br>
        Similarly, I did not change the font of any other text or content as the default font worked fine. The only font I did change is that of the 'Top Content' (mentioned previously)
        and this was just done to make it different from the rest of the text as it did not provide much useful information. But, I did change the font sizes used in the webpages.
        The text size is 18px making it large enough to be readable but smaller than some of the header tags. In tables however, the first row (which is the heading) is not only bold but is 
        also larger at 20px which helps it to be more distingiuishable and makes the user aware that it is the heading of the table.
        Using padding, borders and margins, I have ensured that text does not go from edge-to-edge of the screen and is within the borders. This helps with readability and looks more modern and clean.
    </p>
        <br>

    <h3 class="headline">Flow of Content</h3>
    <p class="about">The general flow of the content goes from top to bottom as the user scrolls towards the bottom of the page. By using subheadings, lists, images, line breaks, I am able to
        make content flow without it seeming overwhelming for readers. As for the table, it does not matter if the reader goes from top to bottom or left to right, it will make sense regardless.
        An improvement that can be made here is to use other ways of displaying informtation to add more character. The images used have an alt text incase images are switched off.
        The tables and images are also labelled so the reader can easily identify what information they are browsing. An accessibility feature that was considered a button that took the user to the top of the page.
        This is typically included in lenghty websites where the user may have to scroll to the top in order to navigate throught to other pages in the website. Taking this into consideration, I added the navigation panel in the footer
        which eliminated the need for the user to go back to the top of the page.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="headline">Adjustment to Other Screens</h3>
    <p class="about">This website has primarily been tested on a 14-inch screen laptop on the browser Google Chrome. I have also tested the website on a larger desktop monitor and on a mobile device.
        On a laptop or desktop screen, the information is well setout, readable, modern and aesthetic and prompts work as intended to. I have created margins and borders around the page to avoid clashes
        with the edges of the screen. This also helps with accessibility as the user can easily see where the content will be displayed. On a laptop/desktop, users with poorer eyesight are able to use the zoom tool 
        from the browsers to be able to read content. The layout and content will stay in-tact upto 200% zoom which should be sufficient enough.
        <br>
        Testing on a mobile device, the page layout and content stays the same meaning it is portrayed exactly how it seen on laptops/desktops.
        Some people find this useful while others find it to be a design flaw. Although the content is visible on the mobile device, users will have to zoom
        in to be able to read text and information. This is another area in which I can improve, make the website more accessibile to those with mobile devices.
